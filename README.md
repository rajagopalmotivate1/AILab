# Hands-on Lab: Deep Learning , Generative Deep Learning, Architecture Search

## 1. Learn CNN Deep Learning for image classification with Transfer learning
## 2. Learn GAN for image synthesis, improve photos with Autoencoders
## 3. Learn to get started towards building your own Neural Architecture Search (let an computer algo find out how different models perform)
